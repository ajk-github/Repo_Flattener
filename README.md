# GitHub Repo Flattener

Sick of bouncing between 50 different files just to understand how a project works? Want to actually read code without GitHub's clunky interface getting in your way? This tool takes any GitHub repo and smooshes it into one beautiful, searchable HTML page. Get syntax highlighting, and the power to Ctrl+F through an entire codebase like a wizard. Plus there's an LLM mode that spits out perfectly formatted text you can paste straight into ChatGPT or Claude.
